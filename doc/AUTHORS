This file contains additional documentation for the abcMIDI package :

Unix Man Pages
--------------
* abc2midi.1 man pages for abc2midi written by Christoph Dalitz.
* midi2abc.1 man page for midi2abc written by Christoph Dalitz.
* abc2abc.1 man page for abc2abc written by Anselm Lingnau.
* mftext.1 man page for mftext written by Anselm Lingnau.

These man pages are now supported by Seymour Shlien

If you wish to preview these man pages use groff with the -man
option. The output is normally in postscript format, but you
can override this using the -a option. For example,
groff -man -a abc2midi.1


To install the man pages, copy them to appropriate directory (typically
this will be /usr/man/man1). You may also need to run mandb after
copying them across.
